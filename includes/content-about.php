				<p>In 2015 Bell and Son converted the Sign of
				 the Bellbird shelter into a fully catered resturant
				 and bar. </p>

				<p>In 1870 it was erected as a shelter to be used as a 
				stopping point for travellers along the Port Hills walkway.</p>
	  
				<p>Sign of the Bellbird continues this tradition as visitors 
				can now come sit and rest with thier friends and family to
				enjoy woodfried pizzas, craft beer and the stunning Canterbury
				landscape.</p>
